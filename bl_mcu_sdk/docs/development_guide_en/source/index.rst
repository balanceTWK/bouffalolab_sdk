BL MCU SDK development guide
========================================================

The `BL702 <https://www.bouffalolab.com/bl70X>`_ series products are general-purpose microcontrollers based on "SiFive E24 Core" `RISC-V <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V>`_ , with network functions such as BLE 5.0, zigbee and Ethernet, as well as other rich peripherals.
It can be used in a wide range of `IoT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>`_ and other low-power applications.
Supports programming and debugging of the chip through `JTAG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG>`_ , and also supports through `UART <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter>`_ programming.
BL MCU SDK will provide users with comprehensive support for BL70X series MCU development.
