SPI
=========================

Introduction
------------------------

Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification for short-range communication. The full-duplex communication mode is used between devices, which is a master-slave mode of one master and one or more slaves, and requires at least 4 wires. In fact, 3 wires are also available (when transmitting in one direction), including SDI (data input), SDO (data output), SCLK (clock), CS (chip select). The SPI devices in the BL series MCU have the following characteristics:

- It can be used as both SPI master and SPI slave.
- The transmit and receive channels each have a FIFO with a depth of 4 words
- Both master and slave devices support 4 clock formats (CPOL, CPHA)
- Both master and slave devices support 1/2/3/4 byte transmission mode
- Flexible clock configuration, up to 40M clock
- Configurable MSB/LSB priority transmission
- Receive filter function
- Timeout mechanism under slave device
- Support polling, interrupt, DMA transfer

    typedef struct spi_device
    {
        struct device parent;

``mode`` provides the following types

.. code-block:: C

    #define SPI_SLVAE_MODE                                0
    #define SPI_MASTER_MODE                               1

``direction`` provides the following types

.. code-block:: C

    #define SPI_LSB_BYTE0_DIRECTION_FIRST 0
    #define SPI_LSB_BYTE3_DIRECTION_FIRST 1
    #define SPI_MSB_BYTE0_DIRECTION_FIRST 2
    #define SPI_MSB_BYTE3_DIRECTION_FIRST 3

``clk_polaraity`` provides the following types

.. code-block:: C

    #define SPI_POLARITY_LOW                              0
    #define SPI_POLARITY_HIGH                             1

``clk_phase`` provides the following types

.. code-block:: C

    #define SPI_PHASE_1EDGE                               0
    #define SPI_PHASE_2EDGE                               1

.. code-block:: C

    #define SPI_DATASIZE_8BIT                            0
    #define SPI_DATASIZE_16BIT                           1
    #define SPI_DATASIZE_24BIT                           2
    #define SPI_DATASIZE_32BIT                           3

SPI Device Parameter Configuration Table
------------------------------------------

Each SPI device has a parameter configuration macro, the macro definition is located in the ``peripheral_config.h`` file under the ``bsp/board/xxx`` directory, and the variable definition is located in ``hal_spi.c``, so the user does not need to define variable. When the user opens the macro of the corresponding device, the configuration of the device will take effect. For example, open the macro ``BSP_USING_SPI0``, ``SPI0_CONFIG`` will take effect, and the ``SPI0`` device can be registered and used.

.. code-block:: C

    /*Parameter configuration macro*/
    #if defined(BSP_USING_SPI0)
    #ifndef SPI0_CONFIG
    #define SPI0_CONFIG \
    {   \
    .id = 0, \
    .clk = 18000000,\
    .mode = SPI_MASTER_MODE, \
    .direction = SPI_MSB_BYTE0_DIRECTION_FIRST, \
    .clk_polaraity = SPI_POLARITY_LOW, \
    .clk_phase = SPI_PHASE_1EDGE, \
    .datasize = SPI_DATASIZE_8BIT, \
    .fifo_threshold = 1, \
    }
    #endif
    #endif

    /*Variable definition*/
    static spi_device_t spix_device[SPI_MAX_INDEX] =
    {
    #ifdef BSP_USING_SPI0
        SPI0_CONFIG,
    #endif
    };

.. note::
    The above configuration can be modified through ``SPI_DEV(dev)->xxx`` and can only be used before calling ``device_open``.


SPI Device Interface
------------------------

SPI device interface follows which provided by the standard device driver management layer.

**spi_register**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``spi_register`` is used to register an SPI device standard driver interface. Before registering, you need to open the macro definition of the corresponding SPI device. For example, define the macro ``BSP_USING_SPI0`` before you can use the SPI0 device. After the registration is completed, other interfaces can be used. If no macro is defined, the SPI device cannot be used.

.. code-block:: C

    int spi_register(enum spi_index_type index, const char *name);

- **index** device index to be registered
- **name** device name to be registered

``index`` is used to select SPI device configuration, one index corresponds to one SPI device configuration, for example, ``SPI0_INDEX`` corresponds to ``SPI0_CONFIG`` configuration, and ``index`` has the following optional types

.. code-block:: C

    enum spi_index_type
    {
    #ifdef BSP_USING_SPI0
        SPI0_INDEX,
    #endif
        SPI_MAX_INDEX
    };

**device_open**

    #define DEVICE_OFLAG_INT_TX     0x004 /* The device is turned on in interrupt sending mode */
